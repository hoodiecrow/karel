
26-element array of structs, (( toupper(char)-'A' )) index

fields: replacement string/NULL

---

byte codes for the basic commands (plus color num for C)

replacement strings compiled down to byte codes--which means they must be
stored in case a replacement is used in another replacement

=R{3L}  -> compiles to an 'L' byte code with a 3 argument
=B{MRP} -> compiles to 'M', 'L'/3, 'P'
